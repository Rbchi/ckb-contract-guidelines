# ckb-contract-guidelines

This repository provides guidelines for writing secure CKB smart contracts. It consists of guidelines, or recommendations kept in this README file, as well as sample C and Rust based smart contracts organized following the guidelines.

Note we still recommend a full code audit for any smart contracts deployed to CKB, even though you might have followed all the guidelines here. The purpose of this repository, is to put together some low hanging fruits that can be done before a security audit, to make sure the code is already in a high quality state, thus minimizing efforts required in a formal audit.
